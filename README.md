Heads up! If you are following along (and using google Gmail account), a recent Google update to their terms and features means you have to do an extra step to be able to send emails.

In the case that you are sending emails through GMAIL,  just go to your account(gmail) -> Account setting -> Scroll to the bottom of the page and you see Less Secured Apps tab ,now you just have to turn that feature ON. for more info visit this:

Third party sites & apps: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521

I recommend turning that feature back OFF once done experimenting with email.
